# scripts

Home of scripts that may or may not be useful in web development activities. These are often scripts that I have written for fairly specific use cases, but may be useful to others in a general sense.

## free-disk-space.sh
	
Set of commands to clean up package, library, and cache files that tend to grow to take up large amounts of disk space, slowing down searching and backups. Removes brew- node- and bower-related extra files, clears all system logs, and empties many application caches. *Note: Removing Google Chrome's application cache causes webpages to initially load without external assets, hence the exclusion.*

**To-Do:**
